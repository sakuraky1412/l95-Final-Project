The slightly simplified version of the Viterbi algorithm that we present takes as input a single HMM and a sequence of observed words O = (o1,o2,...oT) and returns the most probable state/tag sequence Q = (q1,q2,qT) together with its probability.
Coming home from very lonely places, all of us go a little mad: whether from great personal success, or just an all-night drive, we are the sole survivors of a world no one else has ever seen.
